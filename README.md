# -Calculation-of-M-polynomial-and-topological-indices-obtained-of-M-polynomial
To utilize the two-step computer-based computational technique for graph G, follow
the algorithm below:
Step 1: Draw G on a newgraph [51] and calculate its adjacency matrix A.
Step 2: Use our MATLAB program to input matrix A and perform the necessary
computations.
